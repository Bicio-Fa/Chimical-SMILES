# Chimical-SMILES
This project is an interactive web application that converts SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) notations into 2D structural diagrams of molecules.

Features:
Real-Time Conversion: Enter a SMILES code and instantly see the molecular structure.

Album Management: Save your favorite molecules to a local folder (Album/) with custom names.

Error Handling: Validates SMILES entries and checks for duplicate names.

Technologies Used:
Python 3.12

Streamlit: For the responsive web interface.

RDKit: Specialized library for chemical informatics (Cheminformatics).

OS: System file and directory manipulation.
